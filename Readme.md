Project README
Project Overview
This project consists of a frontend built with React and Vite, and a backend built with Node.js. The backend utilizes several libraries including Nodemailer, JWT, and MongoDB, while the frontend incorporates Recoil for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Frontend
Installation
Navigate to the frontend directory:

sh
Copy code
cd frontend
Install the dependencies:

sh
Copy code
npm install
Development Server
To start the development server, run:

sh
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the Vite server and open the application in your default web browser. The development server will reload automatically whenever you make changes to the code.

Build
To create a production build, run:

sh
Copy code
npm run build
This will bundle the application into static files for production.

Recoil
Recoil is used for state management in this project. The state logic is located in the src/recoil directory. To add new atoms or selectors, create new files within this directory and import them into your components as needed.

Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. The configuration file tailwind.config.js is located in the root of the frontend directory. You can add custom configurations or extend the existing styles in this file.

To include Tailwind CSS in your components, use the utility classes provided by Tailwind. For example:

html
Copy code
<div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">
  Your content here
</div>
Backend
Installation
Navigate to the backend directory:

sh
Copy code
cd backend
Install the dependencies:

sh
Copy code
npm install
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following variables:

makefile
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
EMAIL_SERVICE=your_email_service_provider
EMAIL_USER=your_email_username
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
Run the Server
To start the server, run:

sh
Copy code
npm start
This will start the Node.js server and listen for requests on the port specified in the .env file.

Nodemailer
Nodemailer is configured to send emails. The configuration is located in the config/nodemailer.js file. Ensure you have set the correct email service provider and authentication details in your .env file.

To send an email, you can use the sendMail function:

js
Copy code
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: process.env.EMAIL_SERVICE,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});

const mailOptions = {
  from: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  subject: 'Test Email',
  text: 'Hello, this is a test email!',
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
  if (error) {
    return console.log(error);
  }
  console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);
});
JWT
JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for authentication. The secret key is defined in the .env file. To create and verify tokens, you can use the jsonwebtoken library.

Example of creating a token:

js
Copy code
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });
Example of verifying a token:

js
Copy code
const token = req.header('Authorization').replace('Bearer ', '');
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
MongoDB
MongoDB is used as the database for this project. Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running and the connection string set in your .env file.

To connect to MongoDB, use the mongoose library:

js
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
})
.then(() => console.log('MongoDB connected'))
.catch(err => console.log(err));
